## âœ¨ About Me

<p align="left">
Hi! I'm Hannah â€” an Associate Art Producer who loves working with teams to bring beautiful, meaningful game experiences to life.  
I blend creativity with project management, and Iâ€™m especially drawn to **pastel aesthetics**, **collaboration**, and **empowering teams**!

Starting my journey at TRU LUV Inc., where I worked on the #SelfCare app, and continuing at Muus Collective on BELLEMINT Fashion Stylist, Iâ€™ve gained invaluable experience and built expertise â€” all while surrounded by amazing colleagues and mentors whoâ€™ve shaped my path in the games industry.

I bring a creative, fun, and whimsical energy to my work, balanced by determination and a drive to get things done. I thrive in collaborative teams, where everyone supports each other and shares a vision of delivering memorable games to players.

I believe that the best games are made when everyone â€” artists, designers, producers, and engineers â€” feels invested, heard, and motivated to create something bigger than themselves. Thatâ€™s the kind of team Iâ€™m proud to be part of.

Letâ€™s build something players will love!

## ðŸ’– Projects

ðŸ’… [BELLEMINT Fashion Stylist by Muus Collective](https://www.revolve.com/content/lp/bellemint/mobile) - Associate Art Content Producer 2024 - 2025
- On BELLEMINT Fashion Stylist, I managed 2D and 3D art pipelines, overseeing the production and implementation of in-game assets while curating and programming weekly IAP bundles and UX challenges. I helped deliver over 500 assets per month, driving this output through meticulous tracking, strategic sprint planning, and seamless cross-team collaboration. My contributions ensured high-quality, engaging content that aligned with player preferences and elevated monetization.

ðŸ§˜ [#SelfCare by TRU LUV](https://truluv.jenniefaber.com/self-care/) - Product and Operations Assistant 2022 - 2023
- On #SelfCare, I planned and executed user Tendtests (playtests), gathering, compiling, and integrating player feedback to refine and improve features. I helped produce assets for testing and supported feature development, while also fostering an engaged online community through platforms like Geneva, Discord, and Twitter â€” building meaningful connections with players and helping align the product with their needs.
