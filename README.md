## ðŸ’– Projects

- ðŸ§˜ [#SelfCare by TRU LUV](https://truluv.jenniefaber.com/self-care/)
- On #SelfCare, I planned and executed user Tendtests (playtests), gathering, compiling, and integrating player feedback to refine and improve features. I helped produce assets for testing and supported feature development, while also fostering an engaged online community through platforms like Geneva, Discord, and Twitter â€” building meaningful connections with players and helping align the product with their needs.
- ðŸ’… [BELLEMINT Fashion Stylist by Muus Collective](https://www.revolve.com/content/lp/bellemint/mobile)
- On BELLEMINT Fashion Stylist, I managed 2D and 3D art pipelines, overseeing the production and implementation of in-game assets while curating and programming weekly IAP bundles and UX challenges. I helped deliver over 500 assets per month, driving this output through meticulous tracking, strategic sprint planning, and seamless cross-team collaboration. My contributions ensured high-quality, engaging content that aligned with player preferences and elevated monetization.
